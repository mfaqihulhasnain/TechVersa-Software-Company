# Formspree Setup Guide

I've integrated Formspree (a free form handling service) to send emails directly to your inbox. Here's how to set it up:

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Create Formspree Account
1. Go to [https://formspree.io/](https://formspree.io/)
2. Click "Get Started" and sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email address

### 2. Create a New Form
1. In your Formspree dashboard, click "New Form"
2. Give it a name: "TechVersa Contact Form"
3. Set the email destination to: `faqihulhasnain572@gmail.com`
4. Copy the form endpoint URL (it will look like `https://formspree.io/f/xxxxx`)

### 3. Update the Code
Replace the Formspree endpoint in `app/contact/page.js`:

**Find these lines (around line 110 and 171):**
```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://formspree.io/f/xpwgkqpn', {
```

**Replace with your actual Formspree endpoint:**
```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_ACTUAL_FORM_ID', {
```

### 4. Test the Form
1. Save the file
2. Go to your contact page
3. Fill out and submit a form
4. Check your email at `faqihulhasnain572@gmail.com`
